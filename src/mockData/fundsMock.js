This will include a small percentage for necessary staffing and overhead expenses to allow our non-profit partners to serve these needs.\r\n\r\n(2) Assistance for Non-Profit Organizations: Non-profits are already letting us know they will have long-term implications directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Continued basic needs supports - primary strategy is providing basic needs support targeted to those who haven’t (or won’t ever) receive the federal stimulus financial supports.\r\n\r\n•Health: Increase mental health and substance abuse services - primary strategy is scaling up existing mental health and substance abuse providers to be able to serve more people and reach different audiences. Maintaining access to health insurance - primary strategy is helping people navigate accessing health care insurance when they are unemployed. \r\n\r\n•Education: Mitigating the education opportunity gap -  primary strategy is to provide extra resources to support those students who are likely to fall the furthest behind on their educational journeys as our model for learning is being forced to adapt in real-time.

		"purpose":"Medical debt destroys the financial stability of large segments of America’s most vulnerable communities: the sick, the elderly, the poor, and veterans. It also targets the middle class, driving many families who are barely getting along into poverty. Medical debt isn’t the result of bad decisions. It’s a debt of necessity. RIP uses donors’ funds to wipe out medical debt from the neediest cases up. \r\n\r\nOnce we’ve pinpointed the portfolios for those in or near the poverty level, we buy up their debt and forgive it. Then we send forgiveness notices to the benefiting families, and subsequently help the recipients repair their credit reports—renewing their access to opportunities and resources that will allow them to rebuild and recover.",

		"purpose":"The Fund’s offerings are best in class initiatives using systems change approaches that seek to improve outcomes in education, health, and economic mobility. Each has a “backbone” organization that supports the collective efforts of a diverse multi-sector network that puts community organizations in the lead to drive systems change. All have a shared focus: an equitable society where all individuals have an equal opportunity to thrive. \r\n\r\n• Education, Children and Families\r\nThrough their experiences in school, family and community, all young people should be ready to thrive in life. These systems initiatives have a focus on multiple aspects of the readiness journey, including the education systems of early childhood, K-12 and post-secondary as well as a broader set of readiness factors.\r\n• Health and Well-Being\r\nHealth and well-being are multi-faceted issues heavily influenced by the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age. Access to quality health care is important, but a larger contributor to health are the social determinants of health. These initiatives focus on both healthcare and social determinants.\r\n• Economic Mobility\r\nEconomic mobility: the ability of an individual, family, or community to improve their economic situation. This definition is deceptively simple; fulfilling the promise of economic mobility is far more complex and involves multiple interrelated factors that these initiatives address. ",
